# Zitri - share files with ease

[Zitri](https://zitri.io) is an application for sharing files wirelessly. Just like the AirDrop but not only for Apple. It works with all browsers.

### How to use

1. Join the same Wi-Fi on two devices
2. Open [zitri.io](https://zitri.io) on both of them
3. Share you files!

Pretty easy, isn't it?

> If you do not have a common Wi-Fi just create a common room and open it in both devices (for example, [zitri.io/some-room](https://zitri.io/some-room))


### Why Zitri?

✅ **Zitry is freaking fast.** Files are transrefferd peer-to-peer, which means no need to upload and download them from the cloud. It can save you at least 50% of the transfer time. But in local network, you can save even more time!

✅ **No need to create account.** Zitry makes things done without extra steps. It saves your time and focus.

✅ **It's for everyone.** Unlike Apple Airdrop, Zitri is supported by all devices. Needless to say how simple it is.
